# PR Review Standards & Rules

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Canonical Source**: The full list of strict rules and standards is defined in [`.agent/rules/pr-standards.md`](.agent/rules/pr-standards.md).
> All agents MUST follow the standards defined there.

## Key Principles (Summary)
1.  **The Loop Rule**: Review is a continuous loop, not a single check.
2.  **Push Before Trigger**: Never trigger a review on unpushed code.
3.  **Prohibitions**: Never merge, close, or delete branches autonomously.
